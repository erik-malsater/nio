"nio" is a school project where we've created a website using React and Typescript for a fictional restaurant. There, the users can see available dates and make reservations in a digital calendar. Reservation and available dates are saved and retrieved from a database using an API. An admin page was also created where reservations can be created, edited and deleted.
